<!-- In a production app/environment, this file should be excluded from being committed to a repo, i.e. add "*/Config/config-sensitive.xml" to your .gitignore file. -->
<!-- The .csproj has a custom PreBuild MSBuild target that copies an empty templated config-sensitive.xml to the ~/Config/ folder before build. -->
<!-- In a production evironment, you could merge your app keys into that templated config-sensitive.xml at build time (perhaps as part of a CI process), thus keeping your sensitive keys out of your repository. -->
