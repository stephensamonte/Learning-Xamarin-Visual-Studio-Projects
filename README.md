# Learning Xamarin Visual Studio Projects
Xamarin Projects that I worked on while learning how to use Xamarin. 

I learned how to use Xamarin because I was looking for a way to do Crossplatform development. That is program once and it works on both Android and iOS devices. I had prior experience creating Android & iOS Apps. I hated having to create the program once on Android, then another time on iOS. So, to save time regarding development and to reach a larger audience I started to research how to create a cross-platform application.

# Note
- Date Active December 2017 - Janurary 2018
- This was my Visual Studio Xamarin Projects as of 2017.05.10
- My drive for learnign Xamarine was to create CaughtUp Mobile App for Android & iOS (www.caughtup-app.com)
- CaughtUp was first called "FreeTime" during concept and early development
- After creating a few applications and sharing I was encurraged by Dan to look into Flutter (https://flutter.io/) because Xamarin forces me to use Microsoft products and services such as Azure. I left Xamarine and picked up Flutter Development. The Flutter SDK at the time was still in beta.
